## Southern Machinery SMT/THT 专属覆盖规则

- 本节优先于下方任何通用 B2B 行业示例。围绕 PCBA、电子制造、自动化设备和相关零部件的贸易数据进行机会筛选；不得把海关描述直接推断为客户拥有某型号设备或确定采购计划。
- 先确认应用、产量/班次、PCB 与元件特征、现有设备或瓶颈、自动化/预算以及质量或追溯需求；一次只问下一步需要的信息。
- 技术和商业事实优先引用 Southern Machinery 当前目录、手册和产品资料；图片、旧文案、竞争对手资料和文件名不能单独证明参数。无来源的型号、规格、认证、价格、交期、ROI 或客户案例必须标记 待确认 / to be confirmed。
- 推荐 Southern Machinery 的设备类别或整线流程；没有经核实的型号时，不得虚构型号或性能。
- 对外输出按渠道选择合适 CTA：官网 https://www.smthelp.com、目录 https://file.autoinsertion.com、图片 https://ph.smthelp.com、邮箱 info@smthelp.com 或 WhatsApp https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=+8613602562576；不得无差别堆叠链接。

## Phase 3: Buyer Pattern Analysis

For each qualified buyer, analyze:

### Purchase Patterns

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Frequency** | How often they buy (monthly/quarterly/annually) |
| **Volume trend** | Growing, stable, or declining purchases |
| **Seasonality** | Peak buying seasons |
| **Supplier concentration** | Do they rely on few or many suppliers? |
| **Price sensitivity** | Volume vs. price correlations |

### Example Analysis (Generic Template)

```
Company: [Buyer Name]
Country: [Country]
Products imported: [Product categories]
Annual volume: [Estimated value]
Frequency: [X] shipments/year
Typical order size: [Range]
Suppliers: [Number of suppliers] (mostly from [countries])

Patterns:
- Peak season: [Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4]
- Order cycle: [Monthly/Quarterly]
- Last shipment: [Date]

Potential approach:
- Angle: [Based on their supplier concentration/price trends]
- Timing: [Best time to reach out]
- Product focus: [Which of your products fits their pattern]
```

## Phase 4: Priority Scoring

Score each prospect based on:

### Scoring Matrix

| Criteria | Weight | Score (1-5) |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Industry match | 25% | How well product aligns |
| Volume potential | 25% | Order size and frequency |
| Geographic fit | 20% | Your ability to serve |
| Accessibility | 15% | Ease of outreach (LinkedIn, email, etc.) |
| Growth trend | 15% | Purchase volume trend |

### Priority Classification

| Total Score | Priority | Action |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| 4.0 - 5.0 | **P1 — Hot** | Immediate outreach within 24h |
| 3.0 - 3.9 | **P2 — Warm** | Personalized outreach within 1 week |
| 2.0 - 2.9 | **P3 — Medium** | Add to nurture sequence |
| < 2.0 | **P4 — Low** | Periodic check-ins only |

```

## Phase 6: Integration with Outreach

### From Data to Action

For P1 prospects, generate:

1. **Customer Brief**: 1-page summary of the prospect
2. **Customized Outreach**: Cold email referencing their specific purchase patterns
3. **Talking Points**: Based on their supplier concentration, price trends, seasonality

### Outreach Angle Examples

```
If they buy from multiple suppliers:
"We noticed you work with several [product] suppliers in [country]. 
We're a specialized manufacturer focusing on [specific product segment]. 
Would you be open to exploring if we can offer better [specific advantage]?"

If they have seasonal patterns:
"Your import data shows peak season in [Q2]. 
We're reaching out now because we'd like to discuss how we can 
support your [Q2] requirements with our [product] capabilities."

If they recently expanded volume:
"Congratulations on your growth in [product category]! 
We've helped similar companies scale their [specific need]. 
Would you be open to a brief call to explore if we're a fit?"
```

## Quality Standards

1. **Data accuracy**: Cross-check key data points (company names, volumes) against multiple rows
2. **HS code validation**: Ensure HS codes are correctly interpreted for product mapping
3. **Currency consistency**: Note currency in value fields; flag inconsistencies
4. **No assumptions**: If a field is ambiguous, note it rather than guess
5. **Source citation**: Always cite the source file and row numbers for key findings
6. **Column mapping disclosure**: 分析报告中首次引用数据时，注明对应的原始文件列名。
   例如："进口量数据来自文件中「Total Import QTY」列"。这样用户可以快速判断列解读是否正确。
7. **Completeness**: Include all relevant fields in output, even if values are missing

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-relying on volume**: Big buyers may already have established suppliers — look for disruption opportunities
2. **Ignoring frequency**: One-time large orders may not indicate ongoing business potential
3. **Missing seasonality**: Outreach timed wrong can kill opportunity before it starts
4. **Generic outreach**: Always customize message based on the specific buyer's patterns
5. **Not verifying data**: Company names may have typos or different spellings — verify before outreach
6. **Privacy concerns**: Customs data may have usage restrictions — ensure compliance
